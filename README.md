Autoformalization Layer for Symbolic Math AI

Kingfisher converts natural language math problems into a structured
Mathematical Intermediate Representation (MVIR) that can be consumed by:

- symbolic solvers
- theorem provers
- hybrid AI reasoning systems

Think of it as a compiler front-end for mathematical reasoning.

## Goals

- English → structured math IR
- debuggable + validated output
- concept-aware representation
- foundation for symbolic AI

## Status

Phase 0 – Spec & design
